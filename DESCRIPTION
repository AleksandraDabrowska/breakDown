Description: BreakDown Plots are inspired by waterfall plots created by xgboostExplainer (see https://github.com/AppliedDataSciencePartners/xgboostExplainer). The idea behind BreakDown Plots it to decompose model prediction for a single observation. BDPlots show the contribution of every variable present in the model. Such plots will work for binary classifiers and general regression models.
